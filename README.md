# rapid-miner-hear-disease-project
A quick look at RapidMiner Studio v9.10 to see how it helps in quickly applying multiple models to a data-set

The objective of this setup is to apply classification models in RapidMiner in order to classify instances as one of the below, based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle.com
•	Heart Disease: 1, which indicates that instance has heart disease
•	Heart Disease: 0, which indicates that instance does not have heart disease

We shall be using the CRISP-DM process for the workflow.
